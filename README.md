As the above example, this is a dashboard accessible for anyone from one organization/institute which has ConEg system installed.
While a module is not yet configured or is expected to be empty, a ConEg animation will be used as placeholder ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘Œ
It can be accessed from a desktop (nice to show information on a common area) or even from a mobile in order to check more details from specific modules.
